1. Description                           *lazy-local-patcher.nvim-description*

Sometimes, I need to apply small patches to a plugin to fulfill a very niche
use case or to fix something without waiting for the PR to reach upstream.
However, when doing so, Lazy can’t sync the repo because there are local
changes. While Lazy provides ways to handle this (like `dev` or `dir`), they
require manually monitoring and merging upstream changes to stay in sync…

This small plugin addresses this issue by automatically applying the patches
through git commands (if possible) and reverting them before Lazy starts its
lazy magic.

3. Installation                         *lazy-local-patcher.nvim-installation*

>lua
    return {

        config = true,
        ft = "lazy", -- for lazy loading

4. Usage                                       *lazy-local-patcher.nvim-usage*


SETUP                                          *lazy-local-patcher.nvim-setup*

Create the `patches` directory or the plugin will complain about the missing
dir: (default path)

>command
    $ mkdir ~/.config/nvim/patches
<

Here you could add your patches.

- If you need just one patch for a plugin, you can save it in the
  `patches` directory. The name of the patch should match the repository name
  (more precisely, the directory name inside the Lazy root folder), and the
  file extension must be `.patch`. E.g.: `nvim-treesitter.patch` or
  `telescope.nvim.patch`.
- If you need multiple patches for a plugin, you can create a subdirectory
  with a name matching the plugin repository name and save your patches inside
  that directory. E.g.: `nvim-treesitter/1.patch` or `telescope.nvim/1.patch`.


CONFIGURATION                          *lazy-local-patcher.nvim-configuration*

Custom folders could be passed to the `setup` function:

>lua
    require("lazy-local-patcher").setup({
        lazy_path = "/custom/root/lazy/path", -- directory where lazy install the plugins
        patches_path = "/custom/patch/path", -- directory where diff patches files are stored
    })
<


DEFAULTS                                    *lazy-local-patcher.nvim-defaults*

Lazy local patcher comes with the following defaults:

>lua
    local defaults = {
        lazy_path = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/lazy", -- directory where lazy install the plugins
        patches_path = vim.fn.stdpath("config") .. "/patches", -- directory where diff patches files are stored
    }
<


PATCHES                                      *lazy-local-patcher.nvim-patches*

Patches are applied using:

>command
    git -C <plugin_path_in_Lazy_root> apply --ignore-space-change <patch>
<

Example of patch creation:

>
    cd .local/share/nvim/lazy/nvim-treesitter
    nvim edit/some/file
    git diff | tee ~/.config/nvim/patches/nvim-treesitter.patch
<

Now enter into Nvim and sync the plugin with Lazy.


MANUAL EXECUTIONS                  *lazy-local-patcher.nvim-manual-executions*

You could use `apply_all` or `restore_all` functions to manually apply/restore
all patches inside the `patches-path` folder:

>
    :lua require("lazy-local-patcher").apply_all()
    [patches: nvim-treesitter.patch] Applying patch...
    [patches: nvim-treesitter.patch] Done
<

>
    :lua require("lazy-local-patcher").restore_all()
    [patches: nvim-treesitter.patch] Restoring plugin repository...
    [patches: nvim-treesitter.patch] Done
<

5. Contributions                       *lazy-local-patcher.nvim-contributions*

While this plugin is primarily designed for my personal use and tailored to a
very specific use case, suggestions, issues, or pull requests are very welcome.

**Enjoy**
