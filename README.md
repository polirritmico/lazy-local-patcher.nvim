## üêß Description

Sometimes, I need to apply small patches to a plugin to fix something without
waiting for the PR to reach upstream, or simply for custom needs. However,
when doing so, Lazy can't sync the repo because there are local changes... This
small plugin addresses that issue by automatically applying the patches through
git commands (if its possible) and revert them before Lazy starts doing its lazy
magic.

## üìã Requirements

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) >= 0.9.0
- [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) >= 9.24.0


## üì¶ Installation

```lua
return {
    "polirritmico/lazy-local-patcher.nvim",
    config = true,
    ft = "lazy", -- for lazy loading
}
```

## üöÄ Usage

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Create the `patches` directory inside your nvim config folder or the plugin will
complain about the missing dir:

```command
$ mkdir ~/.config/nvim/patches
```

Here you could add your patches. Two considerations:

1. Only **one file** per plugin.
2. The name of the patch should match the repository name. (More precisely, the
   directory name inside the Lazy root folder). e.g.: `nvim-treesitter.patch`


### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Custom folders could be passed to the `setup` function:

```lua
require("lazy-local-patcher").setup({
    patches_path = "/custom/patch/path",
    lazy_path = "/custom/root/lazy/path"
})
```

### Defaults

Lazy local patcher comes with the following defaults:

```lua
local defaults = {
    lazy_path = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/lazy", -- directory where lazy install the plugins
    patches_path = vim.fn.stdpath("config") .. "/patches", -- directory where diff patches files are stored
}
```

### Patches

Patches are applied using:

```command
git -C <plugin_path_in_Lazy_root> apply --ignore-space-change <patch>
```

Example of patch creation:

```
cd .local/share/nvim/lazy/nvim-treesitter
nvim edit/some/file
git diff | tee ~/.config/nvim/patches/nvim-treesitter.patch
```

Now enter into Nvim and sync the plugin with Lazy.

### Manual executions

You could use `apply_all` or `restore_all` functions to manually apply/restore
all patches inside the `patches-path` folder:

```
:lua require("lazy-local-patcher").apply_all()
[patches: nvim-treesitter.patch] Applying patch...
[patches: nvim-treesitter.patch] Done
```

```
:lua require("lazy-local-patcher").restore_all()
[patches: nvim-treesitter.patch] Restoring plugin repository...
[patches: nvim-treesitter.patch] Done
```

## üå± Contributions

While this plugin is primarily designed for my personal use and tailored to
a very specific use case, suggestions, issues, or pull requests are very
welcome.

Enjoy
